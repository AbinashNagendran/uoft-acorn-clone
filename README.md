This is a clone of the landing page of UOFT's website "Acorn" using purely HTML and CSS
My first frontend project, some parts were off and had to use weird paddings/margins, I will learn how fix these small issues
I also could've orginized the styles better
I should've used more semantic tags instead of divs for simple stuff like pure text
